# STA 130-139 · Section 03 · Subsection 132 · Subsubject 008 — Launch, Reentry and Disposal Risk Boundaries

## 1. Purpose

Defines **launch, reentry and disposal risk conceptual boundaries** for space nuclear power systems. Launch safety governed by INSRP process (NASA/DOE/DoD); reentry dispersal analysis required per NASA-STD-8719.14B; disposal orbit requirements per IAEA Safety Series No. 6 (highly eccentric or high-altitude storage orbits). Q+ATLANTIDE STA-132 documents these boundaries conceptually; no operational risk analysis is within scope without separate authority.

## 2. Scope

- **Conceptual boundary applies** — this subsubject is designated conceptual-only per subsection README.md. All content is based on published, publicly available sources. No design, manufacture, deployment, fissile-material handling, or reactor operation is within scope.
- All nuclear energy performance claims cite published mission or technology assessment sources.
