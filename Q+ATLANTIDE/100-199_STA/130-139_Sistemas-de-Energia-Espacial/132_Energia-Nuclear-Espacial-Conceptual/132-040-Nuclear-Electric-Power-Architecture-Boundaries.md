# STA 130-139 · 132-040 — Nuclear Electric Power Architecture Boundaries

## 1. Purpose

Defines the **conceptual architecture boundaries** for nuclear electric power (NEP) systems: primary reactor/RTG → power conversion → thermal rejection → electrical bus. Interface with electrical distribution (→ `133`) and propulsion (→ `122_Propulsion-Nuclear-Conceptual`) at architecture level only. No design or hardware specification within scope.

## 2. Scope

- **Conceptual boundary applies** — this subsubject is designated conceptual-only per subsection README.md. All content is based on published, publicly available sources. No design, manufacture, deployment, fissile-material handling, or reactor operation is within scope.
- All nuclear energy performance claims cite published mission or technology assessment sources.
