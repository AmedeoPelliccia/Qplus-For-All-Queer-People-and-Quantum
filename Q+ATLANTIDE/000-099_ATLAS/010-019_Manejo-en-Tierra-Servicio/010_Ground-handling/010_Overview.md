# ATLAS 010-019 · Section 01 · Subsection 010 — Ground handling

## 1. Purpose

Overview entry-point for the *Ground handling* subsection within the `010-019` code range (Section `01` — *Manejo en Tierra & Servicio*) of the **ATLAS** architecture band (*Aircraft Top-Level Architecture System*, master range `000–099`).

This subsubject (`00 Overview`) introduces the ATLAS 010-019.010.00 slice and links it to the controlled Q+ATLANTIDE baseline[^baseline] and to the applicable industry standards listed in §4.

## 2. Scope

- Covers the *Ground handling* slice of the parent code range `010-019`.
- Inherits Q-Division authority and ORB support from the parent row in [`../../README.md` §3](../../README.md#3-architecture-table)[^archtable].
- **Boundary with subsection `020` *servicing*.** GSE interfaces are jointly addressed: this subsection's [`014_Ground-Support-Equipment-Interfaces.md`](./014_Ground-Support-Equipment-Interfaces.md) covers the *positioning and physical presence* of GSE (where it parks, how it connects mechanically, exclusion-zone footprint), whereas [`../020_servicing/014_Servicing-Points-Couplings-and-Interfaces.md`](../020_servicing/014_Servicing-Points-Couplings-and-Interfaces.md) covers the *functional servicing* through those interfaces (what flows, at what rate, under what protocol). For H₂, exposure is treated here via *exclusion zones* and under `020` via *active replenishment*.
- Subsequent subsubjects (`011`–`019`) under this subsection extend this Overview with detailed data modules per S1000D[^s1000d].
