# ATLAS 020-029 · Section 02 — Sistemas Core de Aeronave

## 1. Purpose

Section-level index for *Sistemas Core de Aeronave* (`020-029`) within the ATLAS band. Sistemas centrales de aeronave: aire acondicionado, eléctrica, hidráulica, controles de vuelo, fuel y energía.

This section is part of the **ATLAS-1000** register, a subpart of the controlled **Q+ATLANTIDE** baseline[^baseline][^n001]. Bands classify technologies, Q-Divisions provide technical authority and ORB-Functions provide enterprise support[^n002].

## 2. Scope

- Aggregates the subsections within the `020-029` code range listed in §3.
- Inherits Q-Division authority and ORB support from the parent row in [`../README.md` §3](../README.md#3-architecture-table)[^archtable].
- Each subsection folder contains its own `README.md` (subsection index) and may contain Overview and subsubject documents.

## Governance

Governed by [`organization/Q+ATLANTIDE.md`](../../../organization/Q+ATLANTIDE.md)[^baseline]. All subsections under this section inherit `architecture_code = ATLAS`, `primary_q_division = Q-AIR` and `governance_class = baseline` from this section header. Templates declared in this section must populate `architecture_band`, `architecture_code = ATLAS`, `q_division_owner` and `orb_function_support` per the Templates System[^templates]. The No-AAA Rule[^n004] applies.
