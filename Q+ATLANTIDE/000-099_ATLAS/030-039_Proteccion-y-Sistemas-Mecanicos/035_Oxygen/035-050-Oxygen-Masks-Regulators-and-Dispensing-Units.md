# ATLAS 030-039 · Section 03 · Subsection 035 · 050 — Oxygen Masks, Regulators and Dispensing Units

## 1. Purpose

Documents diluter-demand and continuous-flow oxygen regulators, crew mask harness and sealing specifications, passenger mask and lanyard dispensing units, and mask container designs.

## 2. Scope

- Diluter-demand regulator: 100% oxygen and normal-dilution modes.
- Mask sealing efficiency and positive-pressure breathing provision for crew.
- Passenger mask lanyard pull-force and deployment envelope.
- Container (passenger DOB) design: door-release mechanism and mask drop sequence.
- Not in scope: oxygen pressure indication (subsubject 060) or servicing procedures.
