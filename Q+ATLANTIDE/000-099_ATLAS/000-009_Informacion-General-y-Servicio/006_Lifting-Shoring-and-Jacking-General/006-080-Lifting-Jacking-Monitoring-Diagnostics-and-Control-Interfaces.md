## 0. Hyperlink Policy

All hyperlinks within this document use **relative paths** from the current file location. Cross-subsection links navigate to sibling files within `./` (same folder), to the subsection index at [`./README.md`](./README.md), and to parent indexes at `../`, `../../`, and `../../../`. Absolute URLs are used only for external standards references.

## 1. Purpose

Defines the monitoring and control interfaces available during lifting and jacking operations on the programme-defined aircraft type. Covers the aircraft inclination sensor outputs, jack-load monitoring interfaces (if applicable), and the CMS maintenance messages related to structural load event recording.

This document is part of the **ATLAS-1000** register, a subpart of the controlled **Q+ATLANTIDE** baseline. It applies to the [[PROGRAMME-AIRCRAFT] programme-defined aircraft configuration Family](../../../../[PROGRAMME-PATH]/090_[PROGRAMME-AIRCRAFT]-Wide-Tube-and-Wing-Family/) programme, **[PROGRAMME-VARIANT]** configuration.

## 3. System / Function Overview

The **Lifting Jacking Monitoring Diagnostics and Control Interfaces** node describes the digital monitoring, diagnostic alerting, and GSE control interfaces provided for lifting and jacking operations on the programme-defined aircraft type. The Wireless Maintenance Monitoring System (WMMS) integrates data from: (i) jack set load cells (J1–J4), sampled at 10 Hz; (ii) fuselage inclinometers (crown and wing panels), sampled at 1 Hz; (iii) HVDC bus voltage sensor (to confirm de-energisation); (iv) landing gear position sensors (to confirm gear locks). All data streams are displayed on the WMMS maintenance workstation (GAIA-QA client) and recorded in the CSDB maintenance log for each jacking event.

Alert thresholds programmed in the WMMS: load asymmetry >5% → amber alert; load asymmetry >10% → red alert + automatic jack pause command via CAN bus; inclinometer deviation >0.5° (roll) or >1.0° (pitch) → amber alert; HVDC bus voltage >2 V (unexpected energisation) → red alert + audio alarm. All alerts are classified as mandatory-action maintenance messages and require a LAME acknowledgement before jacking can resume. Jacking event data (timestamp, load traces, alarm events) are exported to the CSDB as a structured S1000D maintenance data module (info code "200") and archived for at least 5 years per EASA Part-M requirements.
