## 0. Hyperlink Policy

All hyperlinks within this document use **relative paths** from the current file location. Cross-subsection links navigate to sibling files within `./` (same folder), to the subsection index at [`./README.md`](./README.md), and to parent indexes at `../`, `../../`, and `../../../`. Absolute URLs are used only for external standards references.

## 1. Purpose

Documents the controlled towing attachment points on the programme-defined aircraft type, including the nose gear towing lug, main gear towing attachment provisions, and the approved tow bar and towbarless tractor interfaces. Defines the maximum towing load per towing point and the approved towing speed limits.

This document is part of the **ATLAS-1000** register, a subpart of the controlled **Q+ATLANTIDE** baseline. It applies to the [[PROGRAMME-AIRCRAFT] programme-defined aircraft configuration Family](../../../../[PROGRAMME-PATH]/090_[PROGRAMME-AIRCRAFT]-Wide-Tube-and-Wing-Family/) programme, **[PROGRAMME-VARIANT]** configuration.

## 3. System / Function Overview

The **Towing Points and Equipment** node defines the structural tow attachment points, rated loads, and certified GSE for ground movement of the programme-defined aircraft type. Towing loads are transmitted to the airframe through the nose gear towing lug (NTL-001, forward face of nose gear leg, rated ±800 kN longitudinal, ±100 kN lateral per side). Two body-gear rear towing points (BGT-001L and BGT-001R, main gear trunnion aft attach fittings, rated ±400 kN each) are provided for push-in manoeuvres and hangar positioning only — these are not to be used for towing more than 5 m without nose gear guidance.

Approved GSE: (A) TBLT cradle set Q-TBLT-001 (for nose-gear widths 450–600 mm, compatible with the [PROGRAMME-VARIANT] 520 mm nose-gear track, tow capacity 100 t gross, 28 V DC powered with HVDC adapter for tow-on-charge feature); (B) towbar Q-TOWBAR-001 (standard 3-lug NATO pin, rated 80 t, for backup towing); (C) shear bolts set Q-SHEAR-001 (mandatory, rated 90 kN shear, must be installed in NTL-001 before any tow). The ENWTD must be placed in "tow mode" before any external tow to decouple the electric drive from the nose gear bearings; confirmation is displayed on the GMMS maintenance screen. All tow attachments are documented per the Pre-Move Checklist (Q-GMMS-CHECK-001).
