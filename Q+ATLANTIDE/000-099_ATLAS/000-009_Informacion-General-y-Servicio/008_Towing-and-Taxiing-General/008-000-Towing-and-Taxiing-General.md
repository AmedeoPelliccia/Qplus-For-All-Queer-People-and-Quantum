## 0. Hyperlink Policy

All hyperlinks within this document use **relative paths** from the current file location. Cross-subsection links navigate to sibling files within `./` (same folder), to the subsection index at [`./README.md`](./README.md), and to parent indexes at `../`, `../../`, and `../../../`. Absolute URLs are used only for external standards references.

## 1. Purpose

Establishes the general framework for towing and taxiing operations on the AMPEL360E eWTW. Defines the towing and taxiing philosophy, principal GSE interface requirements, safety rules for an all-electric aircraft during ground movement, and the documentation structure for all towing and taxiing procedures.

This document is part of the **ATLAS-1000** register, a subpart of the controlled **Q+ATLANTIDE** baseline. It applies to the [AMPEL360e Wide Tube-and-Wing Family](../../../../Programmes_example/090_AMPEL360e-Wide-Tube-and-Wing-Family/) programme, **eWTW** configuration.

## 3. System / Function Overview

The **Towing and Taxiing General** node establishes the framework, definitions, and operational boundaries for all towing and taxiing activities on the AMPEL360E eWTW. The eWTW introduces significant departures from conventional aircraft ground-movement procedures. The primary differences are: (1) the nose gear is equipped with an Electric Nose-Wheel Steering and Taxiing Drive (ENWTD), rated at 55 kW continuous / 80 kW peak, powered directly from the 540 V HVDC bus; (2) main gear electric brake actuators replace conventional hydraulic brake systems, removing all hydraulic lines and fluid hazard zones from the gear bays; (3) the absence of engine bleed eliminates compressor-induced ground wake, reducing turbulent-jet safety distances around the aircraft.

The ENWTD enables the eWTW to taxi under electric power alone, without starting the main turbofan engines, from the gate to the runway hold point ("e-taxi"). Towing is required for tight gate manoeuvres, pushback, and hangar moves. Towbarless towing (TBLT) with a nose-gear cradle is the preferred method for line operations; towbar towing is approved as a backup. All towing and taxiing ground operations are supervised by the GMMS (Ground Movement Management System) which monitors gear loads, ENWTD current, brake temperature, and steering angle, and is linked to the WMMS-LW for weight data. Ground crew communication is provided by the Wireless Ground Interphone (WGI) system (ARINC 615).
